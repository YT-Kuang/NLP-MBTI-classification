# NLP-Based MBTI Personality Classification

This project leverages natural language processing techniques to classify personality types based on textual data. The classification is performed using the [MBTI Personality Types 500 Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/zeyadkhalid/mbti-personality-types-500-dataset), which contains approximately 100,000 preprocessed records of posts along with their corresponding personality types. The dataset is publicly available on Kaggle.

## Word Embeddings

For text vectorization, this project utilizes the [Google News Word2Vec model](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B7XkCwpI5KDYNlNUTTlSS21pQmM/edit?resourcekey=0-wjGZdNAUop6WykTtMip30g). This model is trained on the Google News dataset and provides 3 million 300-dimensional English word vectors. These embeddings capture semantic relationships between words, enhancing the performance of natural language processing tasks.
